using new functionName() --> we would able to create objects


			
prototype 
-- is a single object, which would be the same across all the object which has been created out of the function 

instanceof

p3.getName();

	this keyword in getName() --> refers to p3

objectName.functionName() 
	--> in this function -- "functionName" -- this keyword would refer to objectName

func1()
	--> this keyword in func1 --> will refer to window.

window.func2()
	--> this keyword in func2 --> will refer to window.
